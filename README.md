## üìå Why This Workshop?

Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) entering the Azure ecosystem face a unique opportunity: **Agentic AI** is rapidly shaping the future of intelligent apps, and Microsoft provides a robust platform to bring those innovations to market securely and at scale.

This workshop is designed for developers who may not yet be familiar with Azure AI but bring strong technical skills and product ideas. By the end of the day, you will have built a **minimum viable product (MVP)** using:

* **Azure AI Agents** for reasoning and orchestration
* **Semantic Kernel** for multi-agent coordination
* **Actions** to integrate external APIs and services
* **GitHub Copilot** to accelerate development and documentation
* **Landing Page UI** connected to your Agent API

---

## üéØ Workshop Objectives

By participating, you will:

* Understand the **value of Azure AI for ISVs** and how it can accelerate product development.
* Gain hands-on experience with **multi-agent patterns** using Semantic Kernel.
* Learn how to use **GitHub Copilot** for faster prototyping and documentation.
* Build a simple **front-end UI** connected to an Agent API.
* Leave with a **working MVP** you can extend into your own solution.

---

## üß† Who Should Attend?

* **ISV-Recruit partners** looking to explore Azure AI capabilities.
* Developers and solution architects with strong technical backgrounds.
* Teams interested in **multi-agent systems, AI-powered applications, and integration scenarios**.
